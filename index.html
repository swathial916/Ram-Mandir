    <h1 class="heading">RAM MANDIR INAGURATION </h1>
    <p>The site is the former location of the Babri Masjid which was built in 16th century CE. The idols of Rama and Sita were placed in the mosque in 1949, before it was attacked and demolished in 1992.
         In 2019, the Supreme Court of India delivered the verdict to give the disputed land to Hindus for construction of a temple, while Muslims would be given land elsewhere to construct a mosque.The court referenced a report from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) as evidence suggesting the presence of a structure beneath the demolished Babri Masjid, that was found to be non-Islamic.
         The bhumi pujan for the commencement of the construction of Ram Mandir was performed on 5 August 2020, by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
         The Ram Mandir is a Hindu temple in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh, India. It is located at the site of Ram Janmabhoomi, the hypothesized birthplace of Rama, a principal deity of Hinduism.
         Rama, an incarnation of Vishnu, is a Hindu deity. According to the ancient Indian epic, Ramayana, Rama was born in Ayodhya.

         In the 16th century, the temple is believed to be attacked and destroyed by Babur in his series of temple raids across northern India. Later, the Mughals constructed a mosque, the Babri Masjid, which is believed to be the site of the Ram Janmabhoomi, the birthplace of Rama The earliest record of the mosque may be traced back to 1767, in the Latin book Descriptio Indiae, authored by the Jesuit missionary Joseph Tiefenthaler. According to him, the mosque was constructed by destroying the Ramkot temple, believed to be the fortress of Rama in Ayodhya, and the Bedi, where the birthplace of Rama is situated.
         
         The first instance of religious violence was documented in 1853. In December 1858, the British administration prohibited Hindus from conducting puja (rituals) at the contested site. A platform was created for conducting rituals outside the mosque.</p>

        <h3>PRIME MINISTER OF INDIA  : NARENDRA MODI</h3>
        <p>PM Modi has been associated with the Ram Temple movement since 1990 and played a crucial role in managing the Rath Yatra of former Deputy Prime Minister LK Advani. 
            The construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya has been part of BJP's main election planks since its inception in 1980. The idea of having a designated place inside one of the most important Hindu shrines for a cast of protagonists who bring out the inclusivity of Lord Ram came, according to sources, from PM Narendra Modi during one of the several sessions he held with those working on the mandir project after the 2019 Supreme Court verdict that cleared the way for its construction.</p>

            <div><img src="https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106940634,imgsize-139226,width-400,resizemode-4/106940634.jpg" alt="" height="300px" width="500px"></div>
        <p>A Ram bhakta since childhood, as he recalled in his special address last week, and a crucial figure in the Ram mandir movement, Modi emphasised the need for quality, sensitivity and a futuristic approach both for construction of the temple as well as development of Ayodhya. Thus, in one of the meetings, he emphasised the need to make the temple accessible to the physically challenged.
            In a meeting on June 26, 2021, in the aftermath of the deadly second wave of the pandemic, Modi asked all agencies to ensure that all projects were woven into the larger scheme of Ayodhya’s development as a modern city. The result — construction of a greenfield international airport, upgrade of Ayodhya railway station, building of highways and cruises on Saryu river.
            Modi told members of the temple trust that while faith may draw people to holy places, it didn’t guarantee a longer stay. “The PM said focus should go beyond temple visits, and ensure that visitors stay for a few days to experience the city’s diverse attractions,” said an officer, adding that the suggestion inspired multiple projects.
            During the Deepotsav in Ayodhya in 2018, Modi emphasised the historical connection between Ayodhya and Korea as the princess of Ayodhya was married to Korea. He suggested highlighting and strengthening this connection to showcase Ayodhya and Lord Ram’s relevance internationally. Following his guidance, the First Lady of Korea was invited to Ayodhya, solidifying a lasting relationship.
            Sources said the PM, recognising the importance of the shrine, also said the temple needed to be a strong structure that should endure at least a thousand years, an insistence which led the temple construction committee to step out the conventional box.
            Sources said Modi regularly reviewed progress of the projects with the temple trust, UP CM Yogi Adityanath, PMO officials, and ministers and officers from UP.</p>

            <h3>RAM AND SEETA</h3>
            <p>The seventh incarnation of Lord Vishnu was Lord Rama who was born to King Dasharatha and Queen Kaushalya in Ayodhya in Treta Yuga. Shree Ram belongs to the ‘Ikshvaku dynasty’ founded by King ‘Ikshvaku’ the son of Lord Surya, which is why Ramchandra is called ‘Suryavanshi’. Shri Ramachandra; the central figure of the Hindu epic Ramayana is a major deity in Hinduism; especially important to Vaishnavism. Born in a royal family, Lord Rama’s life was challenged by unexpected circumstances such as exile for 14 years and several moral dilemmas and ethical questions.  

                The incarnation of Vishnu as Shri Ram and the sufferings he faced all through his human life proves that Satogun Vishnu is in the cycle of birth and death. He is not eternal. At one time, Lord Vishnu rests on the bed of Sheshnag in his abode ‘Vaikunth’ and at another time he incarnates on earth and suffers in human birth. Shrimad Devi Bhagavata (Durga) Purana and Shiv Mahapurana provide evidence that Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva are in the cycle of birth and rebirth. They are mortal. 
                
                Keeping in view the aforesaid, a deep study has been done of the holy scriptures which proves that not Lord Rama of Ayodhya but Aadi Rama who resides in the immortal world ‘Satlok’ should be worshipped about whom devotees are ignorant to date. 
                
                It has been mentioned in Sukshma Veda
                
                राम राम सब जगत बखाने, आदि राम कोई बिरला जाने ||
                
                Ram Ram sab Jagat bakhaney, Aadi Ram koi birla janey.
                The happiness and peace to the creature is under the shelter of the true spiritual leader who plays the divine spectacle of an enlightened saint since He grants true salvation mantras and liberates souls from the web of butcher Brahm-Kaal. He is the provider of salvation. This happiness is not found even in Lord Vishnu’s abode ie. Vaikunth.

                The whole world due to lack of true spiritual knowledge worships Lord Ram alias Lord Vishnu who cannot relieve souls from the vicious cycle of birth and rebirth since they themselves are trapped in the web of Brahm-Kaal. 
                
                This write-up will give readers an overview of the life of ‘Maryada Purushottam Ram’ to whom innocent devotees had been worshipping since ages with great reverence considering he was a divine-human whereas facts from epic Ramayana and other holy scriptures contradict the same and reveal that Aadi Ram; the immortal Satpurush residing in the seventh sky in the ultimate abode ‘Satlok’ is worthy to be worshipped. He is Omnipresent, Omniscient, Omnipotent. 
                
                It has been mentioned in Sukshma Veda.
                
                एक राम दशरथ का बेटा, दूजा सकल पसारा |
                तीजा घट घट का वासी, चौथा दुनिया से न्यारा ||
                
                Ek Ram Dasharatha ka beta, dooja sakal pasara
                Teeja ghat ghat ka vaasi, chautha duniya se nyara
                
                Let us dive into the facts and focus on the following points: Let's study who is worshipable Aadi Ram?
